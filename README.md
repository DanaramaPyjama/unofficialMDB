The + to MDBList (Unofficial) app, acts as a share target in android 12+

This allow a user to quickly add an IMDB title from the IMDB app to their [MDBList.com](https://mdblist.com) watchlist
From IMDB, share your movie or show and choose + MDBList Unofficial from the share menu, and the application will automatically extract the IMDB ID from the share URL, then uplaod the show to your MDBList "My Watchlist".

Feel free to use the app, fork the repo or whatever.  This app was a personal project for me, so it does not come with any support.
